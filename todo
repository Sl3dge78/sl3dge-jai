- [X] Update the renderer : 
    - Register the scene objects once and do multiple passes (eg: shadow map, color)

- [X] Figure out why the normals don't work!!!
- [ ] Better materials
- [ ] Unify descriptor sets
    - [ ] Global buffer
    - [ ] Diffuse/Normal/... texture (local)

// --------
// Things to iron out

- [X] Why do I need to reflect the light on X in the color fragment shader
    -> Normals where inverted on the model

- [ ] Handle timings in the engine
